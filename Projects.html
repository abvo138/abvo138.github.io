        <h2>Projects I've Worked On</h2>
            <h3 style = "margin-left: 20px;">Project 1: Senior Honor's Project</h3>
            <h4><i style = "margin-left: 20px;">Investigating Metal Concentrations in the Nectar of 
                <i>Cucurbita pepo</i> Flowers Across Time and Sexes</i></h4>
            <p style = "margin-left: 50px;">
                My honors project integrates skills from my data science and biology classes to address 
                the research question of whether there are significant differences in metal concentrations 
                between the nectar and nectaries (nectar-producing tissues) of <i>Cucurbita pepo</i> (squash) 
                flowers across different time points and sexes. Nectar, a sugary substance secreted by 
                plants to attract pollinators, contains a variety of nutrients and metals that can influence 
                interactions with pollinators. Given the rising levels of metals and chemicals in soil due to 
                anthropogenic activities, understanding these concentrations has real-world implications.

                The project is divided into two sections. The first section involved a literature review, 
                which provided a foundation in plant and nectar biology. From this, I wrote an introduction
                for a publishable scientific paper focused on metals in nectar and analyzed data on metal 
                concentrations in nectar and nectaries of <i>C. pepo</i>. Using the statistical platform R, I identified 
                key variables, meaningful relationships, and relevant comparisons. I created figures to illustrate 
                trends in the concentrations of 19 metals over time and between sexes. This work aims to 
                contribute to nectar chemistry research and its potential impact on pollinator health, while also
                allowing me to apply my knowledge from both biology and data science.

            <h3 style = "margin-left: 20px;"> Project 2: Research Project</h3>
            <h4><i style = "margin-left: 20px;">Assessing Neuromuscular Fatigue in Pediatric Oncology Survivors</i></h4>
            <p style = "margin-left: 50px;">
                As a result of remarkable progress in oncology, it is now expected that over 80% of children 
                diagnosed with cancer will be long-term survivors. Unfortunately, chemotherapy side-effects are 
                significant and may involve protracted consequences. Specifically, the drug vincristine can cause 
                peripheral neuropathy. While sensory impairments due to neuropathy have been well documented, less
                 is known about the effects on motor function. Previous studies found that children who had recently
                (within months) completed vincristine treatment walked more slowly than age-matched controls and 
                kept their forefoot in contact with the ground for a longer time during each step. We hypothesize that
                 this finding reflects susceptibility to fatigue brought on by neuromuscular damage, and we wish to 
                 determine if such deficits endure long term. Using a variety of tests, we measure strength and 
                 fatigue in recovering pediatric oncology patients and compare their function with control subjects. 
                 We administer surveys that assess subjective experiences of daily fatigue, we perform clinical tests
                of peripheral nerve function, and we have participants complete a six-minute walk test. We also record
                electromyograms (EMGs) while using dynamometers to test grip force and dorsiflexion force while 
                participants complete fatiguing trials (e.g., 40 sequential repetitions of 3 second  maximal 
                contractions with equivalent rest periods between contractions). At this point, we have tested five 
                non-central-nervous-system cancer survivors who received vincristine therapy (average age = 18.2 
                years; average time since treatment end = 67.8 months) and 33 control participants (average age = 
                18.0 years). Our preliminary results suggest that years after finishing chemotherapy, survivors 
                continue to experience more daily fatigue, cannot produce as much dorsiflexion force, and cannot 
                walk as quickly. This suggests that health care providers should conduct long-term follow up on 
                the neuromuscular function of childhood cancer survivors.
